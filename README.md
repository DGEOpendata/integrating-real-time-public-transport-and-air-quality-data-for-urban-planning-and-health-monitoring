# Integrating Real-Time Public Transport and Air Quality Data

This document provides a step-by-step guide to implementing the integration of real-time public transportation usage statistics with air quality index (AQI) data. This guide is designed for users with varying technical expertise.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Access to the internet to fetch datasets.
- Python installed on your machine along with the pandas and requests libraries.

## Setup

1. **Install Python and Libraries**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Use the following command to install the required libraries:
     bash
     pip install pandas requests
     

2. **Access Data Sources**
   - Public Transport Data: Available as a CSV file from [Abu Dhabi data portal](https://data.abudhabi/public_transportation.csv).
   - Air Quality Data: Available in JSON format from [Abu Dhabi data portal](https://data.abudhabi/real_time_aqi.json).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Fetch Data**
   - Use the `requests` library to fetch the AQI data.
   - Use `pandas` to read the CSV file for public transport data.

2. **Process Data**
   - Normalize the JSON data for AQI using `pandas.json_normalize()` to convert it into a DataFrame.
   - Select necessary columns from both datasets for analysis.

3. **Merge Datasets**
   - Use `pandas.merge()` to combine the datasets on a common column, such as the region or station name.

4. **Analyze**
   - Filter the merged dataset to identify areas with high AQI values (e.g., AQI > 100).
   - Suggest alternative transportation routes for regions with high pollution levels.

## Example Code

Refer to the provided Python script to execute the steps outlined above. Ensure the URLs are correctly specified and accessible.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can successfully integrate and analyze real-time public transport and air quality data to enhance urban planning and public health monitoring in Abu Dhabi.
